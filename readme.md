# Lurking Navigation for Robot Activity Support (RAS)
These files are optimized to work in the Tokyo lab. Changes would need to be made to be able to generalize to other labs and in homes, such as acquiring a list of sensors from that location and a new slam map generated by RAS. 

## Initial Requirements
0. ssh into the turtlebot 
1. Initialize roscore
2. (in ras_navigation) run go.py 

### Running Lurking AI 
* **Dynamically**, using realtime sensor data:
    1. run sensor_watcher.py
    2. Set 'Simulated=False' inside lurking_ai.py
    3. Set 'display_all=' inside lurking_ai to True if you want to see all the maps, or False if you want to observe the algorithm's placement preferences instead. 
    4. run lurking_ai.py 

* **Statically**, using historical sensor data from a text file:
    1. Set `'Simulated=True'` inside lurking_ai.py
    2. run simulator.py
